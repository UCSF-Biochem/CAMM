## Microscope
CAMM’s first microscope is a VIVO 2-Photon system designed for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live animals and tissue. 

**Features:**
 
 * Dual galvanometer bidirectional scanning allows for up to 6 frames, 3000 lines or 2,500,000 samples per second with a maximum frame size of 4096 x 4096. Can perform frame, line, curve, multi-region, and multi-point scan patterns.

 * 8 KHz resonant scanning enables 30 frames/second acquisition with a 2048 x 2048 maximum frame size. 

 * Zeiss W Plan-Apochromat water dipping objective, 20x/1.0NA, 2.4mm working distance.

 * 2 GaAsP PMTs in the nosepiece for red and green imaging. 

 * 1 multialkali PMT for transmitted IR imaging. 

 * Epifluorescent light path with red and green filter cubes.

 * Dodt contrast.

 * Luigs & Neumann XY stage with interchangeable bridges for slice and in vivo preparations. Slice bridge includes heated chamber.

 * SlideBook software for VIVO 2P enables seamless acquisition and powerful analysis with complete hardware control and full integration of optogenetics and electrophysiology metadata.


**Offline Workstation**

Users have access to a powerful imaging analysis workstation equipped with SlideBook.
