CAMMâ€™s first microscope is a VIVO Multiphoton system designed for high-speed imaging of live animals and tissues.

**Features:**

 * Dual galvanometer bidirectional scanning allows for up to 6 frames, 3000 lines or 2,500,000 samples per second with a maximum frame size of 4096 x 4096. Can perform frame, line, curve, multi-region, and multi-point scan patterns and spot or spiral photostimulation

 * 8 KHz resonant scanning enables 30 frames/second acquisition with a 2048 x 2048 maximum frame size

 * Zeiss W Plan-Apochromat water dipping objective, 20x/1.0NA, 2.4mm working distance

 * 2 GaAsP PMTs in the nosepiece with red and green emission filters

 * 1 red-shifted multialkali PMT for transmitted IR imaging

 * Epifluorescent light path with red and green filter cubes

 * Dodt contrast

 * Luigs & Neumann XY stage with interchangeable bridges for slice and in vivo preparations. Slice bridge includes heated chamber

 * SlideBook software for VIVO Multiphoton enables seamless acquisition and powerful analysis with complete hardware control and full integration of optogenetics and electrophysiology metadata


**Offline Workstation**

Users have access to a powerful imaging analysis workstation equipped with SlideBook.
