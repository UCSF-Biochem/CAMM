**About CAMM**

The Center for Advanced Multiphoton Microscopy was established in 2016 as a partnership between UCSF and 3i. CAMM will provide the UCSF research community with access to cutting-edge multiphoton instruments for high-speed live imaging. The centerâ€™s first microscope is a VIVOTM 2-Photon system with the option of either dual galvanometer or resonant scanning. 

**About 3i**

[3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovations)](https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/) designs and manufactures cutting edge live cell and intravital microscopy imaging platforms driven by 64-bit SlideBook software. 3i was established in 1995 by a group of scientists whose wide range of research activities includes cell biology, immunology, neuroscience and computer science. Our collective aim is to provide advanced multi-dimensional microscopy platforms that are intuitive to use, modular in design, and meet the evolving needs of investigators in the biological research community.
