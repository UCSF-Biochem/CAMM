**About CAMM**

The Center for Advanced Multiphoton Microscopy was established in 2016 as a partnership between UCSF and 3i, funded in part by generous contributions from the Weston Havens Foundation. CAMM will provide the UCSF research community with access to cutting-edge multiphotoninstruments for high-speed, in vivo, live imaging. The centerâ€™s firstmicroscope is a VIVO Multi-Photon system with the option of either dual galvanometer or resonant scanning.
 
The resonance scanning functionality of this system enables rapid 4D image acquisition with limited light scattering for imaging at depth in complex tissue. Full-field acquisition rates are up to 30 frames per second with faster frame rates achievable for smaller fields of view. The dual galvanometer scan head enables flexibility in scanning mode for image acquisition and photo-stimulation. The system is capable of FRAP and photo-uncaging. The system is equipped with a state of the art Luigs-Neumann stage with interchangeable bridges for use with diverse preparations that rage from tissue slices to whole organisms.  The stage also includes temperature control. The system is controlled by user-friendly Slidebook software. The core facility includes access to an offline data analysis workstation equipped with the Slidebook software.

**About 3i**

[3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovations)](https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/) designs and manufactures cutting edge live cell and intravital microscopy imaging platforms driven by 64-bit SlideBook software. 3i was established in 1995 by a group of scientists whose wide range of research activities includes cell biology, immunology, neuroscience and computer science. Our collective aim is to provide advanced multi-dimensional microscopy platforms that are intuitive to use, modular in design, and meet the evolving needs of investigators in the biological research community.
